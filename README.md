# 8-Puzzle Solver using Informed Search Algorithms
This repository provides Python implementation of heuristic search algorithms, A* and Hill Climbing to solve the classic 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles and one blank space, with the goal of reaching a specific configuration by sliding tiles one at a time. The A* algorithm combines the path cost (g-score) and heuristic estimate (h-score), using techniques like misplaced tiles and Manhattan distance to find the optimal solution efficiently by exploring the most promising paths. Hill Climbing, on the other hand, is a simpler approach that iteratively moves to a neighboring state with a lower Manhattan distance, but it may get stuck in local optima and does not guarantee a solution.
